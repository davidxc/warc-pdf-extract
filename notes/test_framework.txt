### Test Framework

1000 random already-identified PDF documents
    => segment by JSTOR (OCR), born-digital, etc

Workflow:
    => collect papers and crossref metadata

Test:
    => title and author-last-name numbers
    => DOI match against elasticsearch (w/ crossref data), using title search
       and then author list compare
