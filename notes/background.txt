### General Extractors

- ScienceParse: https://github.com/allenai/science-parse
- GROBID: https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid
    => actually pretty fast
    => automatically talks to crossref (!)
    => docker support
- CERMINE
x ParsCit
    => only works on text; has poor reputation
    => http://aye.comp.nus.edu.sg/parsCit/
x biblicit
    => based on ParsCit, explicitly recommends GROBID
x pdf-extract
    => from Crossref; unmaintained
    => ruby

### Quick and Dirty Extractors

x Referencer (GNOME): DOI or arxiv only
x zotero
    just uses google scholar, short-circuiting with JSTOR
    https://zotero-manual.github.io/zotero-manual/adding-items#how-retrieve-metadata-work
x calibre?
x pdfx
    => meh.
x RefExtract
    => very reference-oriented
x docear
    uses font size to identify title

### Proprietary

- Mendeley
