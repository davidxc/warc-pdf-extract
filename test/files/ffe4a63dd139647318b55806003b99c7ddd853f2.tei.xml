<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Making an active contribution to sustainable development is a key issue for France. In particular, this issue relates to urban areas. However, combining the demands of traffic, road safety, local life and environmental protection in a single location can be a complex process.</p><p>In April 2006, the government followed the example of other European countries such as Belgium by launching a consultation process involving representatives from institutions and associations involved in the code de la rue (street use code) project. This process was designed to help road managers improve the way in which public space is shared between all types of users, to improve user journey safety, particularly for the most vulnerable, and to encourage sustainable solutions as an alternative to car journeys.</p><p>This desire was reaffirmed in autumn 2007 by Jean -Louis Borloo, minister of state and minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and Spatial Planning for the Grenelle de l'Environnment (the French government's environmental round table).</p><p>The consultation process involved a participative element and focused on lessons learned from both foreign and French experiences. It opened the way to changes in the Code de la route (Highway Code) with decree 2008-754, which was passed on 30 th July 2008.</p><p>The work will not end here , and new working groups are opened to make proposals on several new subjects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">THE REASONS FOR A PROGRAMME</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">A need for a road network for all with calmer traffic</head><p>The Code de la route (highway code) consists primarily of behavioural rules for car drivers and its aim is to improve traffic flow. The roles of the pedestrian or cyclist were, until now, defined only within the context of their relationship with motorised vehicle traffic.</p><p>The 1980s and 1990s saw a turning point in France with the introduction of a partnership programme between central government and local authorities entitled "Ville plus sûre, quartiers sans accidents" (safer, accident-free cities). A new scheme, focused on road safety and the needs of local residents, saw the speed limit reduced from 60 to 50 kmph in urban areas and the introduction of the "30 kmph zone" into the Code de la route.</p><p>Since then, road and street user practices have changed further. Society is now concerned with sustainable development, and particularly with the use of green modes of transport for urban journeys. It is also concerned with improving the way in which conflict between users is managed.</p><p>In order to help road managers improve the way in which public space is planned and shared between citizens, and to provide greater consistency between different traffic zones in towns and villages of all sizes, the French legal framework needed to evolve and a formal set of road network planning rules was required. This is the central motivation behind the work of the government, politicians, transport professionals and user associations and their involvement in the code de la rue project in 2006.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Vulnerable users still pay a heavy price for poor road safety</head><p>Although significant progress has been made in terms of road safety <ref type="formula">(4,</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">INITIAL RESULTS, JULY 2008</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">The first modifications</head><p>The Code de la route has changed following decree no. 2008-754 of 30 th July 2008. This decree introduced the "principle of prudence", governing the relationship between drivers and the most vulnerable, as well as new urban road planning rules.</p><p>Firstly, the principle of prudence towards vulnerable users was accepted and introduced. Article R412-6 of the Code de la route now states that the drivers "must, at all times, behave in a prudent and respectful manner towards other road users. In particular, they must show increased prudence towards the most vulnerable users."</p><p>The changes also included a legal redefinition of specific traffic zones in urban environments, to include pedestrian areas and 30 kmph zones. The concept of the pedestrian priority zone was created and defined. Finally, two-way cycle traffic in 30 kmph zones and pedestrian priority zones is generalized (except in specific cases).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">The three specific traffic zones in brief</head><p>The pedestrian area is a zone dedicated to pedestrians. They have priority over all vehicles except trams. Authorised vehicles, including cycles, move at walking speed. Motorised vehicles only use these zones on exceptional occasions and according to specific traffic regulations set out by the mayor. Authorisation is only granted if the vehicle is serving the pedestrian area itself. Parking is not permitted in this zone.</p><p>The pedestrian priority zone is a new feature. This zone is open to all forms of transport. However, pedestrians have priority over all other forms of transport except trams. Pedestrians can move with total freedom across the entire width of the road (as long as they do not block the movement of traffic unnecessarily). To make this possible, vehicles are limited to 20 km/h. Motorised vehicles may only stop and park in designated areas.</p><p>The "30 kmph zone" is still a zone where vehicles are limited to a speed of 30 kmph. But the new regulation requires specific planning that is consistent with the speed limit and the generalisation of two-way cycle traffic (except in specific cases). This type of planning has a traffic calming effect. In this area, cyclists and pedestrians benefit from improved safety. Pedestrians are able to cross at any point as long as they do so with care. Road users are encountering more and more "30kmph zones" covering several streets or an entire district. In line with the provisions of the PDUs (plans de déplacements urbains - urban transportation master plans), several large cities have now expressed a desire to convert 70% of their networks to "30kmph zones".</p><p>The generalisation of two-way cycle traffic in pedestrian priority zones and "30 kmph zones" has been introduced. In order to encourage cycle use in these zones and to dissuade cyclists from using the pavements on one-way streets open to vehicles, road managers must, unless otherwise specified, make provisions for two-way cycle traffic with suitable signage on each section of road. If necessary, specific materials may need to be used for this purpose. Local authorities have until 2010 to ensure that existing "30 kmph zones" enable two-way cycle traffic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Benefits for road managers and users</head><p>Every conurbation has a road network designed for vehicle traffic. However, this network is also the place where local life is expressed and developed: businesses, education, culture, social activities, etc. Depending on the importance that policy-makers place on each of the network's roles -traffic or local life -there are several possible planning schemes, each of which is consistent with the principle of prudence and the protection of the most vulnerable users: the 70 kmph section, the 50 kmph road, the "30 kmph zone", the pedestrian priority zone and pedestrian areas. Each of these designs has its own set of regulations as defined in the Code de la route, some of which were introduced by the decree of 30th July 2008. users, the consideration of the vulnerable persons and people with reduced mobility in the road education of all the users.</p></div>

The results in 2008 for vulnerable road users don&apos;t show any gain. The speed of the vehicles is involved for many reasons. First one, in urban areas, peripheral vision is essential. The higher the speed, the narrower the field of vision. Peripheral vision widens as speed decreases, so by moderating their speed, drivers are in a better position to identify and anticipate the movements of pedestrians, for whom seeing and being seen is a key gauge of safety. Second one, in situations where drivers are forced to perform emergency braking, lower speed results in shorter stopping distances; collisions can therefore be avoided or, at worst, their severity reduced. (Stopping distance is defined as the total distance travelled both during reaction time and during braking). And finaly, in cases where a collision with a car cannot be avoided, speed has a direct influence on the likelihood of the pedestrian being killed, which increases from 10% at 30 km/h to over 50% at 50 km/h. The chances of survival are zero for a collision at 70 km/h. That&apos;s why the speed of motorised vehicles is a key factor in accidents and in the severity of collisions, especially when pedestrians are involved. The challenge is therefore to reduce vehicle speed. © Association for European Transport and contributors 2009</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3">. THE PROGRAMME METHODOLOGY 3.1 Objectives and actors Taking its inspiration from the Belgian example, the code de la rue programme is designed to raise awareness of the Code de la route as applied to urban areas and, where necessary, to modify regulations by adapting them to the practices of those using public space. With the players from various institutions and associations, it aims to examine the rules of the French Highway Code that are specific to urban areas, to raise awareness of them or to modify them, in order to improve allocation of public space amongst users and to improve the safety of travel for all, in particular the most vulnerable. The programme is managed by the DSCR (Road Traffic and Safety Directorate), with the support of CERTU (Centre for the Study of Urban Planning, Transport and Public Facilities). It brings together national associations representing policy-makers, professionals, users and institutions concerned. The principle of participation underlying the programme implies commitment on two levels: the commitment of the government to push forward the proposals made by the steering committee and the commitment of other actors participating in the consultation process to disseminate the results. 3.2 A real participative programme At the beginning of the programme, a round table with associations took place to identify areas of priority communication, and areas of new rules to implement. It&apos;s important to say that there is a good balance between associations representing users and associations representing technicians, and that all users have been taken into acount. Special attention was given to representatives of disabled people , and especially the visually impaired. The participation of road managers and technicians is interesting for the discussion on financial implications, feasibility, and reasonable deadlines for the implementation of new measures. If necessary, studies or experimentations are launched to ensure that the new regulations have a positive impact on vulnerable user&apos;s safety. Since 2008 visits to cities have been coupled with the technical committees to establish the degree of difficulties on the ground. Visits are also usefull for the identification of good ideas that can serve as a starting point to changing regulations , for example the &quot;linked footpaths&quot; seen in Chambéry.</note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">THE STREET USE CODE CONTINUES TO MAKE HEADWAY…WHAT'S NEW IN 2009?</head><p>Two years after its launch by the Minister for Transport, the « Street Use Code » has led to modifications to the Highway Code and thus to the first regulatory effects of the work undertaken by the numerous players involved. But the work will not end there. In December 2008 and june 2009, the Steering Committee welcomed new proposals and asked the technical committee to embark on new tasks, and opened working groups on several new sujects in 2009, in order to modify the Highway Code : Priority of the pedestrians in crossing, study of the roller and the other one modes with roulette , study of the tramway circulation rules, study of the pavement definition (then the crossing pavement), the car park in the Highway Code, the opening of bus lanes to other An overview of current reflections and an insight into what may result in terms of street design is following.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Additional measures for pedestrian safety</head><p>In addition to the principle of prudence and to the notion of « pedestrian priority zones », other steps taken in 2008 may lead to modifications to the French Highway Code, concerning the safety of crossing pedestrians.</p><p>Pedestrian right-of-way (outside pedestrian areas and pedestrian priority zones) is likely to be modified. At non signal-controlled pedestrian crossings, this would lead to the obligation of drivers to give way to pedestrians if the latter approach the footpath edge or are clearly waiting to cross, and would no longer require that a pedestrian be actually on the crossing.</p><p>To accompany this reinforced right-of-way, safety conditions for crossings will be improved. Obstacles affecting visibility, such as parked motorized vehicles will be prohibited within 5 metres of non signal-controlled pedestrian crossings (3 metres if there is a footpath build-out), in the direction of traffic. Whilst this is not yet obligatory, it is already recommended to create footpath build-outs or bicycle parking areas, so as to improve mutual visibility conditions. Special rules regarding the pedestrian crossing should be removed in the 30 km/h areas (reach a pedestrian crossing when there is one less than fifty meters, cross the floor in the extension of the sidewalk, perpendicular to its axis). It is suggested that pedestrians cross wherever they want after checking traffic in these specific areas.</p><p>Also related to the safety of crossing pedestrians are traffic regulations for permanent tracked transport such as tramways, (not currently governed by the French Highway Code), which could be specified and applied to such vehicles. Until right-of-way regulations have been clarified, when a transport line with a high level of service is created, it is advised to design signal-controlled crossings only. If this is not the case, it may lead to pedestrians being given right-of-way over tracked transport, which may deteriorate the level of service.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Rollerskaters…and others little vehicles</head><p>Roller skaters and users of similar wheeled means of travel are currently considered as pedestrians, whereas for the most experienced, their speed is closer to that of cyclists. Their status and travel amongst other road users is currently being examined. Initial outcome could be the opening of cycle paths / tracks to these types of users. Until such measures are taken, it is advised to give thought to the width and surfacing of new cycle paths / tracks, so as to facilitate future cohabitation.</p><p>This discussion has been supplemented by the definition of traffic rules for small vehicles, motorized or not, and wheelchair : places each of them can borrow are defined, and their speed is limited to 6 km/h when they are in areas frequented by pedestrians.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">A regulatory definition of the term « footpath »</head><p>Currently, the French Highway Code does not give a definition of the term "footpath" and only refers to its uses. Its definition is therefore being examined. This is a necessary forerunner to regulatory modifications, which will introduce «linked footpaths» into the French Highway Code. This definition will cover their uses and will take account of accessibility issues. At the present time, it is generally accepted that a footpath is an area of the road designated for pedestrians, is separate from the carriageway and any area designed for parking and, moreover, is a space which is clearly identifiable in visual terms and can be detected by a cane or by foot. This implies that it could eventually become obligatory to create this distinction in favour of the disabled and notably the blind or visually impaired. This is a clear follow-up to the 2005 law on the integration of the disabled. In concrete terms, the footpath and the carriageway must be distinct from each other. This is true for vehicle traffic lanes, but also more notably for cycle paths, considered as a carriageway in the French Highway Code. In addition, parking spaces will have to be easily identifiable and detectable. Non pedestrians moving on sidewalk will observe a maximum speed of 6 km/h, and souldn't interfere with pedestrian.</p><p>Here again, whether these reflections lead to changes in regulations or not, the local authorities responsible for the creation or redesign of the road space should think ahead and integrate these principles into their technical specifications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Other possible changes</head><p>Other subjects currently on the agenda include moving back the stop line or implementing bike boxes at signal-controlled junctions, (already generalized in the Greater Lyon area), along with introducing bicycle parking facilities in pedestrian areas -within detectable and easily identifiable enclosures.</p><p>Parking is the subject of inter-ministerial work. A major part of this work concentrates on dangerous parking and the classification of prohibited, obstructive, and dangerous parking, based on accident research. Reflection is also underway on parking facilities reserved for certain users.</p><p>Studies have been launched on the consideration of pedestrians when sidewalks are on sites under construction, in order to make recommendations to road managers to accommodate pedestrians and not endanger them. General principles of signage for pedestrians are also being defined.</p><p>Other regulations related to the travel of wheelchair users outside urban areas may also evolve. Two other undertakings may be mentioned, although at the present time they do not concern regulations: monitoring developments on the opening of bus corridors to other users and taking the vulnerable and the disabled into consideration in road education provided to all users.</p></div>
